## Description
CV11 is a dual precision adder/CV source/buffered mult. It can be used to add two CV signals together, add an offset to a CV
signal, provide a constant voltage, split a signal into two outputs, and more. It is a swiss-army knife utility module that I
end up using in just about every patch.

## Module Information
### Features
- 2 inputs & outputs per circuit
- 1 input per circuit normalled to a buffered CV source

### Power Requirements
<1mA +5V, ~10mA +12V, ~10mA -12V

### Files
- KiCad .sch schematic file
- Circuit diagram .pdf file
- *I am not including PCB files at this time, as my system is 2U and would require extensive rework to fit in a traditional Eurorack
  system. You will have to make your own for now, but I tried to make it easier for you by including the .sch file.
